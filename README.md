# Omni-AST

Omni-AST is an innovative library that blends the robust capabilities of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) with the flexibility and simplicity of JSON, creating a hybrid format designed to streamline the manipulation, analysis, and transformation of code. Aimed at offering versatility, Omni-AST enables developers to handle complex data structures and programming logic in a way that is both intuitive and powerful, thanks to its hybrid nature.

## Features

- **Hybrid JSON-AST Structure**: Combines the structural advantages of AST with the ease of use of JSON, allowing for complex code manipulations and transformations.
- **Easy Serialization and Execution**: Facilitates the serialization of code structures and logic, making it executable, which is ideal for dynamic web application development.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simplifies the creation, modification, and sharing of programming logic, enhancing efficiency and safety in software development.
- **Tooling and Integration**: Offers a foundation for developing a wide range of development tools, including linters, formatters, compilers, and interpreters, leveraging the simplicity of JSON and the semantic richness of ASTs.

## Use Cases

Omni-AST is particularly suited for developers and teams looking to:

- Enhance development tools and pipelines with a format that is easy to parse, analyze, and transform.
- Build, modify, and execute complex code structures and logic directly from JSON.
- Facilitate the sharing and distribution of code logic in a format that is both human-readable and machine-executable.
- Foster innovation in web application development through the efficient manipulation of code structures.

## Getting Started

To begin using Omni-AST in your project, you can install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install omni-ast 
```

## Example
Here's a simple example of how to use Omni-AST to represent and manipulate a piece of code logic:

```js
const omniAst = require('omni-ast');

const myLogic = omniAst.serialize({
  // Omni-AST hybrid JSON structure here
});

// Manipulate, analyze, or transform `myLogic`
// Serialize or execute as needed
```
